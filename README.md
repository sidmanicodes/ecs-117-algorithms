# ecs-117-algorithms

Welcome! This repository contains every single algorithm implemented in Python for ECS 117 - Algorithms for Non-Majors at UC Davis

All the algorithms here (should be) functioning and are as well-documented as I could make them. If there are any issues, feel free to let me
know by filing an issue
